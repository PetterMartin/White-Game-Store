Gaming website that lets you buy and play videogames.

## Description

This project where we were given a choice to design and build a website for either videogames, movies or clothing. 
This webpage is suppose to be a rework of Steam, but with a more friendly vibe and easier to use.
Below is a list of things you will see on this webpage.

- A header with a searchbar aswell as a cart and the user sprofile picture
- On the left is the nav-bar that takes you to "home", friends, your gaming library, your downloads and settings.
- The hero section has a scroller that scrolls through the latest biggest releases.
- Below that is a "most popular" section that highlights which games are most popular among the community
- A "for you" section that displays DLC for your games, aswell as games on sale that you might like. 
- A footer that shows off various legal stuff.
